    <h3 id="title">What is Seasonal Flu?</h3><br>
       <p> Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses which circulate in all parts of the world.</p><br>
      <h3 id="title">Four Type Of Influenza Virus</h3><br>
    <p>Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA), the proteins on the surface of the virus. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The A(H1N1) is also written as A(H1N1)pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009 and subsequently replaced the seasonal influenza A(H1N1) virus which had circulated prior to 2009. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics.
        Influenza B viruses are not classified into subtypes, but can be broken down into lineages. Currently circulating influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.
        Influenza C virus is detected less frequently and usually causes mild infections, thus does not present public health importance.
        Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to infect or cause illness in people.</p>
        <h3 id="title">Seasonal Flu in Myanmar</h3><br>
        <p>A new report published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization is helpful in this regard. The authors collected and reviewed data on the occurrence of the flu from 2006 to 2011 in 10 Southeast and South Asian countries. For the three nations closest to the equator – Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore – cases of the flu seemed to be spread evenly throughout the year. In countries slightly further to the north – Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam – there was a clear uptick in flu cases from July to October. These months, of course, correspond to our rainy season.

            While Myanmar was not included in the research, a look at our neighbouring countries Thailand and Bangladesh shows that July, August and September have been the highest intensity flu months in recent years. Until Myanmar has it’s own data, we can probably safely extrapolate that this is the time in which we will benefit most from vaccination. Therefore, it makes sense for doctors to encourage patients to get vaccinated in May and June. 
            
            Vaccine manufacturers formulate separate vaccines for the northern and southern hemispheres. They attempt to target the strains of the influenza virus that are most likely to occur in each temperate climate’s winter season. In an average year the vaccine will protect against 80 percent of circulating virus strains. The southern hemisphere version is produced in Australia and is given in April and May in preparation for the winter. Because this is close to the timing we feel is most useful in Myanmar, we administer the southern hemisphere vaccine in my clinic. Even if international residents living in Yangon were vaccinated in Europe or America last autumn, they may not be adequately protected against the flu during rainy season and should consider getting this vaccine.
            
            In most cases the flu makes you feel crummy for a few days to two weeks – fever, weakness, headache and bone pain are common symptoms. But it can lead to more serious complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, ear infections or sinus infections. Children are particularly vulnerable to the flu, while the elderly account for most of the annual deaths caused by flu-related complications. Another high-risk group is pregnant women. Research has taught us that there is twice the risk of fetal death in women who get the flu while pregnant.
            
            There is no truly effective treatment for the flu. Rest, analgesics and hydration are used while we wait for the symptoms to dissipate on their own. Furthermore the flu is often indistinguishable from Dengue, so the sickness that characterises both diseases may require blood tests to make a diagnosis. For these reasons patients should have a conversation with their doctor in Myanmar to decide if the vaccine is right for them.</p>
