        <h2>Which treatments should I take for flu symptoms?</h2>
        <p>

            The flu treatment you should take depends on your symptoms. For example, if you have nasal or sinus congestion, then a decongestant can be helpful.
            
            Decongestants come in oral or nasal spray forms. Decongestants are used to reduce swelling in the nasal passageways. However, nasal spray decongestants should not be used for more than a few days because, if they are used too long and then stopped, they can cause rebound symptoms.
            
            If you have a runny nose, postnasal drip, or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful for your flu symptoms. Antihistamines block the effect of "histamine," and help relieve such annoying symptoms as sneezing, itching, and nasal discharge.</p>

        <h2> Treatment tips</h2>
        <p>
           
            
                1.<u> Sweating cure</u>
                If you feel a cold coming on, then sweating it out can work wonders. It improves the body’s defences. Take a hot bath with a few drops of thyme oil added to the bath water and drink one or two cups of sweat-inducing tea (elder, linden blossom, camomile blossom or ginger). Afterwards, lie in bed and keep yourself covered. Caution: you should not try the sweating cure if you suffer from cardiovascular or circulatory problems.
               2. <u> Drinking</u>
                Drink plenty of fluids: water, herbal tea or fruit juices.
                3. <u> Sore throat</u>
                Drink chamomile, sage or thyme tea or warm milk with honey to relieve the inflammation.
               4. <u> Dry cough</u>
                For a dry cough, warm milk with honey or plantain and rosehip tea can reduce irritation and tickly throat. For wet, pflegmy coughs, primrose, fennel, anise or thyme tea are more suitable remedies.
               5.<u>  Sniffles</u>
                Dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a litre of water. Use this solution to rinse out your nose. This helps flush out viruses and bacteria in the nasal cavity.
              6. <u> Fever</u>
                Paracetamol and leg compresses help to lower the body’s temperature.
              7.  <u>Leg compress</u>
                Soak two cloths in vinegar and water and place these around the calves. Wrap a terry towel around the compress and cover yourself with a blanket. Replace the compress when the inner towels have warmed up.

        <h2>Treatment tips</h2>
        <p>1.<u> Always carry an umbrella</u>

            Getting wet from a sudden downpour can cause a sudden change in your body temperature that may lead to fever and colds. To avoid getting sick, don't forget to bring your umbrella with you wherever you go. It's not only the best rain gear but also a sickness shield against cough, colds or fever when you're caught up on a rainy day.
            
            2. <u> Keep your nutrition up</u>
            
            Eating healthy food is the cheapest way to protect you from sickness. You can cook a hot soup to invigorate your body or eat Vitamin C-rich foods to boost your immune system to help repulse flu and infection. A delicious and healthy meal is what makes rainy days a little warmer.
            
            3. <u> Wash your hands thoroughly</u>
            
            To keep you from getting colds, cough, and influenza, regular hand washing is the best way to prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria. Wash your hands properly by lathering soap between your fingers, under your nails and the top of your hands. Then rinse and dry your hands thoroughly too.

    <section class="section section-light">
        
        <p> 4.<u> Drink plenty of water</u>
            
            There's nothing better than sipping on a warm drink while the rain pours outside. Keep your hydration levels up by drinking 6 to 8 cups of water a day with a squeeze of lemon. Warm water gets your blood circulation going, which leads to a strong immune system that can protect you against getting infections and allergies.
            
            5. <u> Avoid rush hour commutes</u>
            
            Heavy rains with possible flooding can make commuting more difficult. If you have the chance to avoid hours when congestion is at its peak, do so. Avoid the hassle and the possibility of getting stuck in a downpour, leave earlier in the morning, or talk to your boss about your schedule adjustment.
            
            6. <u>Have some backup clothes ready</u>
            
            Since it's easy to get wet during rainy days, walking around with your wet clothes is like inviting a virus into your body resulting in a fever and common cold. Prevent this by stashing away a pair of extra clothes at the office or at your gym during rainy days.
            
            7. <u>Keep up with weather updates</u>
            
            Stay up-to-date with the latest news and weather forecast which you can monitor not only on the radio and TV but also on social networking sites. Follow accounts that share useful information about weather and traffic updates, which might help you to get rid away from flooded areas and find alternate routes.</p>

        <h2>Treatment tips</h2>
        <p>1. <u>Find Moist Air</u>

            We tend to stay indoors when the weather gets cold, but being in close contact with our loved ones makes people-hopping easy for germs.
            
            In addition, indoor air tends to be lower in humidity. Researchers at Columbia University showed that in dry air, particles emitted from sneezing and spluttering break into smaller pieces and are better able to stay aloft and inhaled by others. In the damp outdoors, however, particles are more likely to stay intact, dropping heavily to the ground and out of harm’s way.
            
            
            2. <u>Train Five Days a Week (or at Least Think About It)</u>
            
            Numerous studies have demonstrated that exercising regularly cuts cold and flu infections. In one 12-week study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers found that exercising five days a week reduced upper-respiratory tract infections by almost 50 percent.
            
            
            
           
            3. <u>Get a Daily Dose of D</u>
            
            Sunlight is in short supply during the winter, but as the primary provider of vitamin D, it’s essential that you get some sun exposure during the darker months. According to a three-year study published in Epidemiology and Infection, people who took 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily had 70 percent fewer colds and flu than those taking a placebo.

    <section class="section section-dark">
        
        <p>4.<u> Stay Two Arms’ Lengths Away</u>
            
            If there’s an outbreak of flu in your immediate environment, keep your distance. A study from Wake Forest School of Medicine revealed that infectious flu-containing particles exhaled by a sick person travel about 6 feet.
            5. <u>Clean Up After Yourself</u>
            
            In The Secret Life of Germs, author Philip Tierno, Ph.D., suggests sanitizing all shared items in your home and office: door handles, remote controls, computer keyboards, oven buttons, and so on.
            
            “Rhinoviruses [the predominant cause of the common cold] can live on surfaces for up to 48 hours,” he writes. So give tables and taps a good rub down with disinfectant at least once a week—more if you have a sniffler in your midst.
            6. <u>Double Down on Vitamin Z</u>
            
           
            
            In a survey carried out by the University of California, participants who said they slept for 5 hours or less on an average weeknight were 28 percent more likely to catch a cold—and 82 percent more likely to contract the flu—compared with those who slept for 7 to 8 hours on weeknights.
            7. <u>Eat More Protein</u>
            
            And finally, a study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases shows that diets low in protein can weaken the immune system. So add protein-rich foods such as milk, Greek yogurt, eggs, and fish to your daily menus and eat your way into good health this winter.</p>
