               <p>A sore throat is pain, scratchiness or irritation of the throat that often worsens when you swallow. The most common cause of a sore throat (pharyngitis) is a viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. A sore throat caused by a virus resolves on its own.

                Strep throat (streptococcal infection), a less common type of sore throat caused by bacteria, requires treatment with antibiotics to prevent complications. Other less common causes of sore throat might require more complex treatment</p>

                    Symptoms of a sore throat can vary depending on the cause. Signs and symptoms might include

                    <li>Pain or a scratchy sensation in the throat </li>
                    <li>Pain that worsens with swallowing or talking</li>
                    <li>    Difficulty swallowing</li>
                    <li>Sore, swollen glands in your neck or jaw</li>
                    <li>Swollen, red tonsils</li>
                    <li>White patches or pus on your tonsils</li>
                    <li> A hoarse or muffled voice</li></ul>

                    <h3 id="h3">Causes</h3>
                    <p>

                        
    Allergies. Allergies to pet dander, molds, dust and pollen can cause a sore throat. The problem may be complicated by postnasal drip, which can irritate and inflame the throat.
    Dryness. Dry indoor air can make your throat feel rough and scratchy. Breathing through your mouth — often because of chronic nasal congestion — also can cause a dry, sore throat.
    Irritants. Outdoor air pollution and indoor pollution such as tobacco smoke or chemicals can cause a chronic sore throat. Chewing tobacco, drinking alcohol and eating spicy foods also can irritate your throat.
    Muscle strain. You can strain muscles in your throat by yelling, talking loudly or talking for long periods without rest.

    Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a digestive system disorder in which stomach acids back up in the food pipe (esophagus).

    Other signs or symptoms may include heartburn, hoarseness, regurgitation of stomach contents and the sensation of a lump in your throat.

    HIV infection. A sore throat and other flu-like symptoms sometimes appear early after someone is infected with HIV.

    Also, someone who is HIV-positive might have a chronic or recurring sore throat due to a fungal infection called oral thrush or due to a viral infection called cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can be serious in people with compromised immune systems.
    Tumors. Cancerous tumors of the throat, tongue or voice box (larynx) can cause a sore throat. Other signs or symptoms may include hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, noisy breathing, a lump in the neck, and blood in saliva or phlegm.

Rarely, an infected area of tissue (abscess) in the throat or swelling of the small cartilage "lid" that covers the windpipe (epiglottitis) can cause a sore throat. Both can block the airway, creating a medical emergency.</p>
                        
<p> Infections causing a sore throat might result in other signs and symptoms, including: </p>
<ul><li> Fever</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li> Runny nose</li>
<li> Sneezing</li>
<li> Body aches</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting</li></ul>

                   <h3 id="h3">Overview</h3><br>
                   <p>Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.

                    For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.
                    
                    Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.</p>
                    <h3 id="h3">Symptoms</h3>
                    <p >
    
                        Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time.

Asthma signs and symptoms include:

                            A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. These include:
                            
                                Having a blood relative (such as a parent or sibling) with asthma
                                Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis (hay fever)
                                Being overweight
                                Being a smoker
                                Exposure to secondhand smoke
                                Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution
                                Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing
                            </p>

                                Asthma complications include:
                                
                                    Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work or recreational activities
                                    Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups
                                    Permanent narrowing of the bronchial tubes (airway remodeling) that affects how well you can breathe
                                    Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks
                                    Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma

                       <p>Norovirus infection can cause the sudden onset of severe vomiting and diarrhea. The virus is highly contagious and commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated during preparation or through contaminated surfaces. You can also be infected through close contact with an infected person.

                        Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting typically begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure. Norovirus symptoms usually last one to three days, and most people recover completely without treatment. However, for some people — especially infants, older adults and people with underlying disease — vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention.
                        
                        Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships.</p>

                        <p >

                            <ul>
                                
                            <li> Nausea
                            </li>
                            <li> Vomiting</li>
                            <li> Stomach pain or cramps</li>
                            <li> Watery or loose diarrhea</li>

                            </ul>

                           Signs and symptoms usually begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure to norovirus and last one to three days. You can continue to shed virus in your feces for up to two weeks after recovery. This shedding can last weeks to months if you have an underlying health condition.

                           Some people with norovirus infection show no signs or symptoms. However, they are still contagious and can spread the virus to others.</p>
                            <h3 id="h3">Causes</h3>
                            <p>
        
                                Noroviruses are highly contagious and are shed in the feces of infected humans and animals. You can get norovirus by:

                             Eating contaminated food
                             Drinking contaminated water
                             Touching your hand to your mouth after your hand has been in contact with a contaminated surface or object
                              Being in close contact with a person who has a norovirus infection

                                Noroviruses are difficult to kill off because they can withstand hot and cold temperatures and most disinfectants.</p>
                                <h3 id="h3"> Complications</h3>
                                <p>For most people, norovirus infection usually clears up within a few days and isn't life-threatening. But in some people — especially children, older adults and people with compromised immune systems — norovirus infection can cause dehydration. Norovirus infection can cause severe dehydration, malnutrition and even death, especially in people who are older or immunocompromised, or in women who are pregnant.

                                    Warning signs of dehydration include:
                                    
                                        Fatigue
                                        Dry mouth and throat
                                        Listlessness
                                        Dizziness
                                        Decreased urine output
                                    
                                    Children who are dehydrated might cry with few or no tears. They might be unusually sleepy or fussy.</p>

                            Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.
                            
                            Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.
                            
                            Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

                                    The two main types of arthritis — osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis — damage joints in different ways.
                                    Osteoarthritis
                                    
                                    The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to your joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones where they form a joint. Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection.
                                    
                                    Osteoarthritis also affects the entire joint. It causes changes in the bones and deterioration of the connective tissues that attach muscle to bone and hold the joint together. It also causes inflammation of the joint lining.
                                    Rheumatoid arthritis
                                    
                                    In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint</p>

                                    <p>

                                        Risk factors for arthritis include:
                                        
                                            Family history. Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder. Your genes can make you more susceptible to environmental factors that may trigger arthritis.
                                            Age. The risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age.
                                            Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men.
                                            Previous joint injury. People who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint.
                                            Obesity. Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine. People with obesity have a higher risk of developing arthritis.
